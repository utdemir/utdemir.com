# Hi,

I'm **Utku Demir**, a software developer from Auckland, New Zealand.

I try to create simple and composable code, declarative and reproducible
infrastructure, and ethical software. Functional programming is my
preferred tool of choice, regardless of the language.

I'm currently a part of [SoWork](https://sowork.com/).

Here are some links about me:
